# ICS Merger
*presented by Yuhang Zheng*

## Problem Statement
I have been interested in so many events on campus and would like to import those events to my Google Calendar to keep track. However, Google Calendar only takes one .ics file at a time for importing.

After some research, I realized an .ics file has a fairly straightforward format and would like to write a simple merger program myself!

## Instructions
1. Download the entire repository to your local device.
2. Delete the sample .ics file under the `to_be_merged` directory.
3. Move desired events into the `to_be_merged` directory.
4. On terminal, run `python3 ics-merger.py`.
5. A new .ics file with the prefix `"merged-calendar-"` will be generated, which contains all the desired events.
6. Import this new file into your calendar of use. Now you can safely delete the events in the `to_be_merged` directory.

Enjoy!
